## Call Centre Performance
#### Description
Call Centre Manager is looking for an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behaviour. She is interested in information such as total calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, call duration, overall customer satisfaction, etc.
#### Data Preparation
The dataset was provided by the company. After familiarizing myself with it, I performed initial data cleaning tasks, including renaming columns, checking for duplicates and missing values, and adding columns to simplify date and time analysis.

#### Key Takeaways
- Even Distribution of Call Topics: Call volume and related statistics are evenly distributed among topics, suggesting no single topic is more prominent than others.
- Unanswered Calls: Nearly 20% of calls go unanswered, which may indicate longer wait times and potential client dissatisfaction.
- Resolution Rate: With a resolution rate of about 70%, the call centre demonstrates moderate effectiveness.
- Customer Satisfaction: The average satisfaction rating is 3.4. To improve this score, the centre should focus on reducing answer times and increasing the resolution rate through additional agent training and optimizing agent scheduling to better meet demand.
